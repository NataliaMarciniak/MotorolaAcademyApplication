A few words about me.
I'm self-learner with a lot of passion for programming.
My first contact with programming languages was when my boyfriend started a programming course and every day he tried to explain to me what was he doing that day.
After a while i wanted to know more, so I started my own learning path.
I want to change my life a bit, start something new, and I think programming is fascinating and definately something I want to do in the future, and I would be grateful if you would give me this opportunity.
